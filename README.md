# Web Scraping script

## Description
This repo is intended for testing purposes. You are provided with a web scraping script for an Amazon page, it extracts data products' data. 

## Getting started

Copying the repository

Due to the public nature of forks we suggest you duplicate the repo rather then forking it.
You will need to create your own repo e.g. `[your_github_username]/web-scraping` and then clone this repo `luidcrua/web-scraping` and push the code into your new one. You can follow the steps for doing this here: https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/

Before proceeding be aware that this exercise assumes you are using a linux machine with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable) and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) installed.

To initialize the repository in your base directory execute ./initialize_repo.sh

This script will install Django 3.10 and other libraries required for the application. It also loads a fixture to prepopulate the database with some test data for the application
